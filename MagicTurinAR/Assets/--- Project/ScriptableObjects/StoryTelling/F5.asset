  fragmentText: 'Last but not least, [user], you are the Wiseman. You hold a very
    important position because you can manage the inventory and you have the needed
    skills to solve the enigmas you will be facing. Inventory management is crucial
    for the flux of this experience: you need to balance the needs of your teammates
    and give them the essential amount of White Magic Fragments and manage Gems thoroughly
    to avoid running out of energy for the team. On the map, you can find and collect
    Wite Magic Fragments themselves and ancient Magic Books.'
