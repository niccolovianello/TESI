  fragmentTitle: 
  fragmentText: ', you are the Hunter, the most dynamic member of this magic team.
    Your most important goal is to defeat the Demons you will find around you using
    your magic powers. Pay attention to your energy because every spell you cast
    reduces your Mana: you have to try to maintain a pretty high accuracy level to
    complete every mission. You can be asked to destroy a Gem by the Wiseman, to
    generate some fresh White Magic Fragments. On the map, you can see some monsters
    to fight and collect Runes.'
