  textBeginMission: It's your turn! After spawning the demon on the ground, cast
    your spells and try to kill it. The basic spell (left button) is less powerful
    but subtracts 10 mana points. The other spell (right button) is super powerful
    but it will cost you 50 mana points.
  textFinishMission: You made it! Now the wiseman will try to solve his enigma and
    discover the location of the next demon's hideout!
